Feature:  character's skin
          As a gamer,
          in order to customize the character,
          I want to have more skins.
          The skins are introduced to customize the character
          and make the game experience more funny.
          
          Scenario: the game starts
                    Given that I am on the main menu
                    When I click on the "Settings" button
                    And then I click on the "Skin" button
                    all the possible skins are displayed
                    And the gamer can choose from one of these.
