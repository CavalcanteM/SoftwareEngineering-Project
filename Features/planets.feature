Feature: planets
        As a developer,
        in order to make the game more realistic
        i want to change gravity depending on the level.
        
        Scenario: Different levels on different planets
            If the level is on the earth the gravity is normal
	    But if the level is for example on the Moon the gravity is 1/6 than that of the Earth
	    So the change of gravity will be different
            The same thing if the gravity is greater than that of the Earth
